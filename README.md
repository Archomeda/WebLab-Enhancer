About
=====
Coding large applications takes a lot of space. WebLab isn't designed for this. This script will try to stretch the editor to the edges of your browser. It will add some key bindings as well.
However, it is not guaranteed that this script will still work in the future as WebLab is currently in beta and may be updated regularly.

Installation Instructions
=========================
This script is designed for Greasemonkey for Firefox. Please install Greasemonkey first otherwise this script will not install.
There's no guarantee that this script will work in other browsers.

* Click on weblab_enhancer.user.js
* Click on the button Raw (top right of the page)
* Greasemonkey will take over automatically and prompt you to install the script

How To Use
==========
The key bindings are based upon [JW's Chrome extension](https://github.com/jw-moonshine/weblab-chrome-extension "jw-moonshine's weblab-chrome-extension"):
* CTRL/ALT + S:	Save & Compile
* CTRL/ALT + Shift + S: Submit
* ALT + R: Run Your Tests
* ALT + Shift + R: Run Specification Tests

Unfortunately CTRL (+ Shift) + R is not supported as Firefox will enforce refreshing the page.
